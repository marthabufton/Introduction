Being with poetry this term has been transformative, in part because I don’t feel as intimidated by reading poetry (some poetry anyway) than I did in January. But also because I enjoy the feeling of marveling that I can have when I’m reading (or seeing) something in a profound way because of a poetic image. I think I now can give myself over to American poet and scholar John Ciardi’s (1959) advice regarding our relationships with poetry:

“... the language of experience is not the language of classification … so for poetry. The concern is not to arrive at a definition and to close the book, but to arrive at an experience” (p. 666).

So, Anne McCrary Sullivan’s poem How *I learned to love Picasso* allows me to “arrive at an experience,” a positive experience of being a beginner researcher. When I read the poem, I can literally see myself in front of *Les Demoiselles D’Avignon* (either at the MOMA in New York or at the National Gallery of Canada—although, more profoundly, I’m with *Three Musicians*, which has been a part of my life forever. My mother had a print hanging in our home when I was a child and, after attending the NGA Picasso exhibit in 1998, I rushed to the gift shop and bought my own copy. It hangs in our basement and I see it everyday. In either case, I always at least mentally stop and think, “What does this mean?” And then I laugh, because my experience is always happy when I look at the dog, zigzagging his way through the painting ,,, perhaps a metaphor for being transported by music? Or maybe just a technical experiment?  Whatever, laughter is there for me.

And this happens to me all the time as a researcher. At first, I can only stare at a great work of art, in my case a well-written piece of academic literature and think, “What do I make of this? How do I understand how it’s constructed and “how” does it mean?” And I find that sometimes, the way in is to focus on one aspect and try to imagine or understand why it is important, or at least what it might mean for me. (And let go of all the rest for a while.)

For example, why is it important to look for new types of sources as an historian as Natalie Zemon Davis has done with historical French legal documents? In my case, why, are oral histories “new” or “different” forms of evidence and storytelling that allow for or prompt new interpretations? What would my history of unions at Carleton been like without these “lines”? Or conversely, in my analysis, what meaning could I see in a transcript where a line is literally missing or a word misspelt? How would that reshape my interpretation?

One aspect of our shared practice of reading, doing, and reflection, that has been like a “line out” has been to write without a set of weekly or at least “throughout the term” deadlines. Initially, when I realized that we would have lots of writing to do but were not required to “hand in homework” every week, I almost panicked. First, I was worried about having too much to do at the end of the term. But then, I pondered how much I would learn week to week if I didn’t have to produce something on time and receive a grade. How much could I or would I learn?

A void.

But obligations were there, not the least of which, was to write a poem and share it. And the weekly readings grabbed me and, holding my hand, tore off at a fast pace towards (re) connections to other parts of my life. I’m talking with my co-op  student about digital humanities tools such as Voyant and all of sudden, it’s got an obvious connection to text analysis and coding. Next thing I know, I am introducing my practicum student to the tool so that she can have the experience of doing some first-cycle coding on and interview transcript she has been cleaning up. Another example: Now I know I am an interpretive scholar (not a positivist scholar) and having this vocabulary enriches my conversations with graduate students who are trying to decide if they will use qualitative research tools such as NVivo … or not.

So, I may not be handing in assignments on a regular basis but I am constantly linking ideas to my daily life and this all of the work that’s been done this term is “writ large” in this portfolio, a form which I find liberating because it encourages me to “mean” each aspect of my work in ways that are (at least slightly) more creative and liberating then such writing endless streams in a Google doc. I think I am “possibilitizing” my ideas in a form that makes for more interesting sharing.
